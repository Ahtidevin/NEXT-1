	    Active learning methods automatically adapt data collection by selecting the most
	    informative  samples  in  order  to  accelerate  machine  learning.   Because  of  this,
	    real-world testing and comparing active learning algorithms requires collecting
	    new datasets (adaptively), rather than simply applying algorithms to benchmark
	    datasets, as is the norm in (passive) machine learning research.  <br><br>To facilitate the
	    development, testing and deployment of active learning for real applications, we
	    have built an open-source software system for large-scale active learning research
	    and experimentation.  The system, called NEXT, provides a unique platform for
	    real-world, reproducible active learning research. This paper details the challenges
	    of building the system and demonstrates its capabilities with several experiments.
	    The results show how experimentation can help expose strengths and weaknesses
	    of active learning algorithms, in sometimes unexpected and enlightening ways.

	    Publishing data and software needed to reproduce experimental results is
	    essential to scientific progress in all fields.  <br><br>Due to the adaptive nature of data collection in active
	    learning experiments, it is not enough to simply publish data gathered in a previous experiment. For
	    other researchers to recreate the experiment, the must be able to also reconstruct the exact adaptive
	    process that was used to collect the data.  This means that the complete system, including any web
	    facing  crowd  sourcing  tools,  not  just  algorithm  code  and  data,  must  be  made  publicly  available
	    and easy to use. <br><br> By leveraging cloud computing, NEXT abstracts away the difficulties of building
	    a data collection system and lets the researcher focus on active learning algorithm design.   Any
	    other researcher can replicate an experiment in under one hour by just using the same experiment
	    initialization parameters.

	    NEXT puts state-of-the-art active learning algorithms
	    in the hands of non-experts interested in collecting data in more efficient ways.  <br><br>This includes psy-
	    chologists, social scientists, biologists, security analysts and researchers in any other field in which
	    large amounts of data is collected, sometimes at a large dollar cost and time expense.  Choosing an
	    appropriate active learning algorithm is perhaps an easier step for non-experts compared to data col-
	    lection.<br><br>

	    NEXT is accessible through a REST Web API and can be easily deployed in the cloud with minimal
	    knowledge and expertise using automated scripts.   NEXT provides researchers a set of example
	    templates and widgets that can be used as graphical user interfaces to collect data from participants
	    (see supplementary materials for examples).
